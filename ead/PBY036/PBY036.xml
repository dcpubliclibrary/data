      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Based upon a search of the 1834 and 1843 city directories, none of the non-servant names could be ascertained as living in Georgetown. The first entry dated May 2, 1833, reads, "Removed to a frame house on D Street between 6th and 7th belonging to C.W. Boteler," and the second entry, dated June 22, 1833 reads, "Removed to a two-story brick house on F Street, corner of 6th belonging to E. Fitzgerald, U.S. Navy." It could be inferred that the writer was residing at these locations. (Research has revealed that this paper was manufactured by Robert Donaldson, Phenix Mill, Hanover Township, Morris County, NJ. Active circa: 1820-1840.)</p>
