      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Service Employees International Union has always sought to organize workers in a wide range of occupations. Beginning with janitors and elevator operators when it formed in 1921, SEIU soon added security guards, window cleaners, health care workers, office workers and public sector employees. By 1968, the union represented service workers in over 100 occupations around the nation.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>After the initial donation to the Library, the transcripts were placed in folders and stored them in a filing cabinet with other oral histories. Tapes were placed a cabinet for patron use. In 2014, the tapes and transcripts were digitized and in 2017 the collection was reprocessed. Transcripts were placed into folders and boxed. Audio cassettes were organized and boxed. All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file. There is no 14-01 tape or transcript for this collection.</p>
