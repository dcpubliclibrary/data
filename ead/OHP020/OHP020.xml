      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Between 1997 and 1999 the D.C. Public Library and Councilmember Hilda Mason's office jointly sponsored a program to conduct oral histories of D.C. Statehood movement leaders. The project was funded by a grant from the D.C. Humanities Council and documents the experiences of 10 important Statehood movement leaders. The interviews cover such topics as memories of activist Julius Hobson, the early founding of the Statehood Party, local politics and referendums, constitutional convention, and the defeat of the statehood legislation. After the completion of the project the Library held  a Statehood Forum at the Library and an audio recording of that event is also included with this collection.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>After the initial donation to the Library, the transcripts were placed in folders and stored them in a filing cabinet with other oral histories. Tapes were duplicated by the Library with use copies being placed a cabinet, while the originals were placed into off-site cold storage. In 2014, the tapes and transcripts were digitized and in 2017 the collection was reprocessed. Transcripts were placed into folders and boxed. Audio recordings were organized and boxed for long term storage. All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file.</p>
