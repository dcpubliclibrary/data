      <p>- Little information from standard genealogy resources could be gleaned about the signatories. The 1820 U.S. Census indicates that Broom had one slave between age 14 and under 26. Broom died in July of 1828 and was buried in a walnut casket, location unknown. - Livers was born between 1752 and 1762. He died Jan. 7, 1821 and was also buried in a walnut casket, location unknown. - If anyone can decipher the [?] words, please do.</p>
