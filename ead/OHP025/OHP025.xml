            <p>Transcript of oral history interviews with Ibrahim Mumin. In his interviews, Mumin describes his activism during his time as a student at Howard, which attempted to push Howard to become more involved with the community. Mumin explains a sense of activism attached him to Shaw. He mentions Fides House, a community center that offered services to the Shaw community. He also touches upon the entertainment venues and restaurants he used to visit in the area. Mumin notes how his experience in activism and the confrontations it led to prepared him for the 1968 riots. Reflecting on why the riots occurred, Mumin felt that people struck out at businesses out of anger, which led to many businesses and middle-class whites fleeing the community altogether. Mumin also presents his perspective on Shaw's present and future, in terms of economics, culture, and community.</p>

            <p>The third of four oral history interviews with Barbara Taylor Hunter. Taylor describes the fashion and culture of Shaw and Howard University in the 1960s. She touches upon the nature of Howard's political organizations and the area's music scene. Hunter reflects on how Shaw changed as a result of the 1968 riots. She notes that much of the neighborhood's older character was lost from destruction of architecture, the departure of many families, and an increase in housing costs. As a former high school teacher, she also discusses the schools in Shaw and her continued relationships with former students.</p>

He reflects on Shaw's history, particularly on the reasons for the 1968 riots and the effects it had on the community.

            <p>The seventh of seven oral history interviews with Ibrahim Mumin. In his interviews, Mumin describes his activism during his time as a student at Howard, which attempted to push Howard to become more involved with the community. Mumin explains a sense of activism attached him to Shaw. He mentions Fides House, a community center that offered services to the Shaw community. He also touches upon the entertainment venues and restaurants he used to visit. Mumin notes how his experience in activism and the confrontations it led to prepared him for the 1968 riots. Reflecting on why the riots, Mumin feels that people struck out at businesses out of anger, which led to many businesses and middle-class whites fleeing the community altogether. Mumin also presents his perspective on Shaw's present and future, in terms of economics, culture, and community.</p>
