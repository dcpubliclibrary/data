      <head>Processing Procedure</head>
      <p>Even though many of the images within the album have come loose (a few are fully detached) over the past century, a decision was made to not disassemble the album.  Processor placed buffer sheets on each page of the album and placed detached images in polyester sleeves. Detached images were left in their original location. The album was then placed in an archival storage box for long term storage. An item level inventory was not performed.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>According to census records, Ingaborg "Inga" Forsberg was born in Washington DC in 1891, and lived at 626 F Street, SW. Newspaper searches revealed that she was a debutante and her name appeared in several societal news stories, including an article about a New Years masquerade party she hosted in 1910, which is documented within the album. Newspaper stories also indicate that she married E. Frankcombe Davis in 1913. Following her marriage there are no other mentions of her in the Washington Post and Evening Star and no other biographical information could be obtained.</p>
