      <p>The Center for Inspired Teaching's Real World History (RWH) is a city-wide high school history course that gives students applied history experience and exposes them to public history work through the cultural heritage institutions of the D.C. region. Each fall RWH students learn about the Great Migration through reading The Warmth of Other Suns, by Isabel Wilkerson, and embark on a semester-long oral history project with a Washingtonian who came to D.C. as part of the Migration. Together students and their narrators record life history interviews about the experience of migrating from the Jim Crow South to the D.C. Region.</p>

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries. She worked at libraries within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) before retiring from the public sector in 1995. Ms. Crutchfield then began work in private law firms. She had one daughter who passed away in 2015.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries. She worked at libraries within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) before retiring from the public sector in 1995. Ms. Crutchfield then began work in private law firms. She had one daughter who passed away in 2015.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>James Jackson was born June 10, 1936, in Oates, South Carolina, but he grew up in nearby Hartsville SC. Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

Most young men in his town picked tobacco to make a living, but Dr. Harris looked to education as his way out, a way, his family emphasized, to "being somebody."

After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric. After saving up enough money, he moved to Washington, D.C., to complete his college education at Howard University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952. While at Howard, Dr. Harris joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and went into the service upon graduation. He served as an officer in the Korean War between 1952-1954 before returning to Howard to receive a Master's in African Studies in 1956. He then went on to earn a PhD from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he met his wife. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Guinea, and later became a professor of history at Howard University.</p>
