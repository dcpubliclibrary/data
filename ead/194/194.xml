      <p>The Center for Inspired Teaching's Real World History (RWH) is a city-wide high school history course that gives students applied history experience and exposes them to public history work through the cultural heritage institutions of the D.C. region. Each fall RWH students learn about the Great Migration through reading The Warmth of Other Suns, by Isabel Wilkerson, and embark on a semester-long oral history project with a Washingtonian who came to D.C. as part of the Migration. Together students and their narrators record life history interviews about the experience of migrating from the Jim Crow South to the D.C. Region.</p>

              <p>Willie Williams was born in the 1940s in Tarboro, North Carolina. Despite living in the country, he attended school in Tarboro and was working in upstate New York during the summers by the time he was in high school. After graduating from high school in 1962, Mr. Williams attended college at Fayetteville University for a time before moving to D.C. at the suggestion of a friend. When Mr. Williams first came to the District, he lived with his uncle in Fairfax Village in far Southeast. After working for a couple years, Mr. Williams joined the Army. After leaving the Army in 1969, Mr. Williams and his wife moved back to Washington and lived near 28th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. He worked at the United States Postal Service for a several years before taking advantage of the G.I. Bill and enrolling at Federal City College (now UDC). After four or five years of part-time enrollment he graduated in 1977 with a degree in business education. Mr. Williams then attempted to become a CPA but ultimately didn't complete his certification, and he went on to work a variety teaching positions (teaching accounting for the National Park and Planning Commission in Maryland, teaching typing at Cortez Peters Business College, and substitute teaching in D.C. Public Schools) before becoming a realtor. Mr. Williams remained in Washington after his retirement in 1992, but some time after 2016, he moved to Kennesaw, Georgia.</p>

Her father was sharecropper and brick mason, who built homes, and her mother was a domestic worker.

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries. She worked at libraries within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) before retiring from the public sector in 1995. Ms. Crutchfield then began work in private law firms. She had one daughter who passed away in 2015.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

              <p>Dr. Joseph Harris was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He was raised by his great aunt and grew up attended segregated schools. Most young men in his town picked tobacco to make a living, but Dr. Harris looked to education as his way out, a way, his family emphasized, to "being somebody." He attended Hampton University for a year but because he could not afford to live on campus, he did not enjoy his experience there and went to work in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where his mother lived. After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric. After saving up enough money, he moved to Washington, D.C., to complete his college education at Howard University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952. While at Howard, Dr. Harris joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and went into the service upon graduation. He served as an officer in the Korean War between 1952-1954 before returning to Howard to receive a Master's in African Studies in 1956. He then went on to earn a PhD from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he met his wife. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Guinea, and later became a professor of history at Howard University.</p>

              <p>Ruth Anne Lee Cohen was born in Savannah, Georgia, in the 1930s. She grew up with her parents, grandmother, and three younger siblings and by age five she was working in her grandmother's confectionary as a cashier. Ms. Cohen's parents and siblings moved to Detroit, Michigan, when she was in the seventh grade leaving her to live with her grandmother. Ms. Cohen attended a segregated Catholic school until seventh grade, at which point she enrolled at Alfred A. Beach High School where she met her husband. After finishing high school, Ms. Cohen attended Savannah State College (now Savannah State University) where she studied elementary education and graduated in 1958. After teaching in Savannah for three years, she moved north to join her husband in Washington. After serving overseas in the military, Ms. Cohen's husband refused to live in the South, and by the time they were married, he had already been living in Washington for a couple years. Ms. Cohen held off on joining him in D.C. until she had taught in Savannah public schools for three years, securing tenure. Once in Washington she continued teaching until her retirement in 1999. She took on other positions after retirement, such as the Business and Professional Women's League, helping students get scholarships to college.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>Jacqueline Hines was born in Wilson, North Carolina on April 27, 1954. Though she was sixth of her mother's seven children, she grew up with only her mother and younger sister in the home since her older siblings were from her mother's first marriage and had already moved out. At the age of 15 in the summer of 1969, Ms. Hines came to Washington, D.C.; her mother and sister came north to join her that fall. Ms. Hines was the first in her family to have a high school diploma (Ballou High School) and to get a college degree (Bowie State University). She gave birth to her son after finishing at Bowie State in 1977, and, after staying home with him for a time, she began her career as an educator. Her first teaching job was in a correctional facility but she later began working in DC Public Schools (DCPS). Ms. Hines retired from DCPS in August of 2019.</p>

              <p>James Jackson was born June 10, 1936, in Oates, South Carolina, but he grew up in nearby Hartsville SC. Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

              <p>Dr. Joseph Harris was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He was raised by his great aunt and grew up attended segregated schools. Most young men in his town picked tobacco to make a living, but Dr. Harris looked to education as his way out, a way, his family emphasized, to "being somebody." He attended Hampton University for a year but because he could not afford to live on campus, he did not enjoy his experience there and went to work in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where his mother lived. After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric. After saving up enough money, he moved to Washington, D.C., to complete his college education at Howard University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952. While at Howard, Dr. Harris joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and went into the service upon graduation. He served as an officer in the Korean War between 1952-1954 before returning to Howard to receive a Master's in African Studies in 1956. He then went on to earn a PhD from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he met his wife. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Guinea, and later became a professor of history at Howard University.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>Jacqueline Hines was born in Wilson, North Carolina on April 27, 1954. Though she was sixth of her mother's seven children, she grew up with only her mother and younger sister in the home since her older siblings were from her mother's first marriage and had already moved out. At the age of 15 in the summer of 1969, Ms. Hines came to Washington, D.C.; her mother and sister came north to join her that fall. Ms. Hines was the first in her family to have a high school diploma (Ballou High School) and to get a college degree (Bowie State University). She gave birth to her son after finishing at Bowie State in 1977, and, after staying home with him for a time, she began her career as an educator. Her first teaching job was in a correctional facility but she later began working in DC Public Schools (DCPS). Ms. Hines retired from DCPS in August of 2019.</p>

              <p>James Jackson was born June 10, 1936, in Oates, South Carolina, but he grew up in nearby Hartsville SC. Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

              <p>Dr. Joseph Harris was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He was raised by his great aunt and grew up attended segregated schools. Most young men in his town picked tobacco to make a living, but Dr. Harris looked to education as his way out, a way, his family emphasized, to "being somebody." He attended Hampton University for a year but because he could not afford to live on campus, he did not enjoy his experience there and went to work in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where his mother lived. After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric. After saving up enough money, he moved to Washington, D.C., to complete his college education at Howard University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952. While at Howard, Dr. Harris joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and went into the service upon graduation. He served as an officer in the Korean War between 1952-1954 before returning to Howard to receive a Master's in African Studies in 1956. He then went on to earn a PhD from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he met his wife. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Guinea, and later became a professor of history at Howard University.</p>

              <p>Deacon Clarence Haywood was born in 1947 in Camilla, Georgia, and he grew up with his mother, grandparents, and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister). For a time they stayed with their father in Atlanta, GA, but they soon returned to Camilla to live with his mother's parents because of issues between his parents. His grandfather, Roy Caesar, was a well-known farmer in Mitchell County, Georgia, and his grandmother was a registered nurse in Camilla. His mother worked in a factory, but she was often battling illness and worked less hours than many of her colleagues. After graduating high school in 1965, Deacon Haywood served in the US Navy for four years. Upon leaving the service, he settled in D.C. and began working at the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a hospital corpsman. He had never visited to D.C. before, and he was the first of his family to migrate north. NIH then paid for him to attend Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, and become a registered nurse. Upon graduating in 1975, he began a forty-year career in nursing. Deacon Haywood has been a deacon at New Bethel Church of God in Christ in Takoma Park, D.C., for over three decades.</p>

              <p>Jacqueline Hines was born in Wilson, North Carolina on April 27, 1954. Though she was sixth of her mother's seven children, she grew up with only her mother and younger sister in the home since her older siblings were from her mother's first marriage and had already moved out. At the age of 15 in the summer of 1969, Ms. Hines came to Washington, D.C.; her mother and sister came north to join her that fall. Ms. Hines was the first in her family to have a high school diploma (Ballou High School) and to get a college degree (Bowie State University). She gave birth to her son after finishing at Bowie State in 1977, and, after staying home with him for a time, she began her career as an educator. Her first teaching job was in a correctional facility but she later began working in DC Public Schools (DCPS). Ms. Hines retired from DCPS in August of 2019.</p>
