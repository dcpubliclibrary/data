      <p>The Center for Inspired Teaching's Real World History (RWH) is a city-wide high school history course that gives students applied history experience and exposes them to public history work through the cultural heritage institutions of the D.C. region. Each fall RWH students learn about the Great Migration through reading The Warmth of Other Suns, by Isabel Wilkerson, and embark on a semester-long oral history project with a Washingtonian who came to D.C. as part of the Migration. Together students and their narrators record life history interviews about the experience of migrating from the Jim Crow South to the D.C. Region.</p>

After arriving in D.C., Ms. Strowder worked in different government offices until she and her husband, Joseph Strowder, had children, at which point she began working in the home.

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries.

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income.

In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>Jacqueline Hines was born in Wilson, North Carolina on April 27, 1954. Though she was sixth of her mother's seven children, she grew up with only her mother and younger sister in the home since her older siblings were from her mother's first marriage and had already moved out. At the age of 15 in the summer of 1969, Ms. Hines came to Washington, D.C.; her mother and sister came north to join her that fall. Ms. Hines was the first in her family to have a high school diploma (Ballou High School) and to get a college degree (Bowie State University). She gave birth to her son after finishing at Bowie State in 1977, and, after staying home with him for a time, she began her career as an educator. Her first teaching job was in a correctional facility but she later began working in DC Public Schools (DCPS). Ms. Hines retired from DCPS in August of 2019.</p>

              <p>James Jackson was born June 10, 1936, in Oates, South Carolina, but he grew up in nearby Hartsville SC. Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

              <p>Dr. Joseph Harris was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He was raised by his great aunt and grew up attended segregated schools. Most young men in his town picked tobacco to make a living, but Dr. Harris looked to education as his way out, a way, his family emphasized, to "being somebody." He attended Hampton University for a year but because he could not afford to live on campus, he did not enjoy his experience there and went to work in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where his mother lived. After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric. After saving up enough money, he moved to Washington, D.C., to complete his college education at Howard University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952. While at Howard, Dr. Harris joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and went into the service upon graduation. He served as an officer in the Korean War between 1952-1954 before returning to Howard to receive a Master's in African Studies in 1956. He then went on to earn a PhD from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he met his wife.

She grew up with her parents, grandmother, and three younger siblings and by age five she was working in her grandmother's confectionary as a cashier. Ms. Cohen's parents and siblings moved to Detroit, Michigan, when she was in the seventh grade leaving her to live with her grandmother. Ms. Cohen attended a segregated Catholic school until seventh grade, at which point she enrolled at Alfred A. Beach High School where she met her husband. After finishing high school, Ms. Cohen attended Savannah State College (now Savannah State University) where she studied elementary education and graduated in 1958. After teaching in Savannah for three years, she moved north to join her husband in Washington. After serving overseas in the military, Ms. Cohen's husband refused to live in the South, and by the time they were married, he had already been living in Washington for a couple years. Ms. Cohen held off on joining him in D.C. until she had taught in Savannah public schools for three years, securing tenure. Once in Washington she continued teaching until her retirement in 1999. She took on other positions after retirement, such as the Business and Professional Women's League, helping students get scholarships to college.</p>

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries. She worked at libraries within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) before retiring from the public sector in 1995. Ms. Crutchfield then began work in private law firms. She had one daughter who passed away in 2015.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>Edith Crutchfield was born on August 28th, 1936, in Culpeper, Virginia. Though Culpeper was segregated, she grew up across the street from a medical professional building, which housed white residents. Ms. Crutchfield remarks that though Culpeper was segregated, this was more integration than she experienced living in D.C. due to housing segregation in the city. Ms. Crutchfield came to the District in 1953 at age sixteen and moved in with her oldest sister and brother-in-law. She studied communication at Howard University as well as the University of the District of Columbia and went on to have a career working in libraries. She worked at libraries within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) before retiring from the public sector in 1995. Ms. Crutchfield then began work in private law firms. She had one daughter who passed away in 2015.</p>

              <p>Eva M. McLeod was born in 1918 in Albany, Georgia. She celebrated her 100th birthday in July of 2018. Graduating high school as valedictorian when she was 15, she went on to what was then Georgia Normal and Agricultural University, now Albany State University, a public HBCU (Historically black colleges and universities). Mrs. McLeod taught for about two years before moving on to a four-year college in Savannah, Georgia, where she met her husband. She and her husband taught for three years in Georgia before he decided to look for work in D.C. At this point she and her husband had three children, and he felt they needed a greater income. After settling in D.C., she found that life was different yet similar in the Black communities, as many people she knew had settled from southern cities. In thinking about moving from Albany to D.C., working and raising her children, caring for her grandchildren and elderly husband before he passed, Mrs. McLeod remarks that, "I've had my hands full all my life."</p>

              <p>Jacqueline Hines was born in Wilson, North Carolina on April 27, 1954. Though she was sixth of her mother's seven children, she grew up with only her mother and younger sister in the home since her older siblings were from her mother's first marriage and had already moved out. At the age of 15 in the summer of 1969, Ms. Hines came to Washington, D.C.; her mother and sister came north to join her that fall. Ms. Hines was the first in her family to have a high school diploma (Ballou High School) and to get a college degree (Bowie State University). She gave birth to her son after finishing at Bowie State in 1977, and, after staying home with him for a time, she began her career as an educator. Her first teaching job was in a correctional facility but she later began working in DC Public Schools (DCPS). Ms. Hines retired from DCPS in August of 2019.</p>

              <p>James Jackson was born June 10, 1936, in Oates, South Carolina, but he grew up in nearby Hartsville SC. Mr. Jackson's parents were sharecroppers, and he recalls how landowners exploited farmers and often cheated them at settlement. After finishing high school, Mr. Jackson went into business with his brother building homes, but he eventually decided to move to D.C. since he wasn't making enough to support his growing family. He initially came to D.C. in 1962 without his family, since he wanted to find housing suitable for his wife and children before they came north. He lived with his sister at first, but he was able to secure housing through a job as a building manager and had his family joined him soon after. He worked as a union carpenter for a couple years before landing a job with the Department of Corrections as the facilities manager for a prison. Mr. Jackson retired in 1990.</p>

After working as a cook at Williams College for a few years, Dr. Harris moved to Schenectady, New York, to work for General Electric.

              <p>Claudia Lewis (née Claudia Johnson) was born September 30, 1937 in Ridge Spring, South Carolina. Ms. Lewis grew up on a farm in Ridge Spring with her parents, Charlie May Johnson and Ulysses Johnson, and six siblings.

Upon arriving in D.C., the family lived on Howard Road SE, but they soon moved to Northeast Washington. Ms. Lewis attended the Birney School on Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE) for a few months upon arriving in Washington, but after moving to Northeast during her sixth-grade year, she attended Burrville Elementary and later Merritt Elementary School. She went on to attend Kelly Miller Junior High before graduating from McKinley High School in 1956. Ms. Lewis then went to New York for a time before returning to Washington to begin a job at the Department of the Navy. She married her husband Elton Lewis in December 1969. After beginning as a mail clerk with the Department of the Navy, Ms. Lewis later became a secretary and remained there for her whole career. In 1992 Ms. Lewis moved to Prince George's County Maryland. Ms. Lewis's husband passed away in 2014, and Ms. Lewis currently lives with her daughter in Maryland.</p>

              <p>Deacon Clarence Haywood was born in 1947 in Camilla, Georgia, and he grew up with his mother, grandparents, and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister). For a time they stayed with their father in Atlanta, GA, but they soon returned to Camilla to live with his mother's parents because of issues between his parents. His grandfather, Roy Caesar, was a well-known farmer in Mitchell County, Georgia, and his grandmother was a registered nurse in Camilla. His mother worked in a factory, but she was often battling illness and worked less hours than many of her colleagues. After graduating high school in 1965, Deacon Haywood served in the US Navy for four years. Upon leaving the service, he settled in D.C. and began working at the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a hospital corpsman. He had never visited to D.C. before, and he was the first of his family to migrate north. NIH then paid for him to attend Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, and become a registered nurse. Upon graduating in 1975, he began a forty-year career in nursing. Deacon Haywood has been a deacon at New Bethel Church of God in Christ in Takoma Park, D.C., for over three decades.</p>

              <p>Thelma D. Jones' work has been fundamental to civic and youth activism and raising awareness of breast health. She is an award-winning community activist, breast cancer survivor, advocate, and founder of the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund. Diagnosed in 2007 with a rare (unknown primary) and aggressive form of breast cancer (HER2+), her treatment regimen included chemotherapy, surgery (lumpectomy) and radiation. Jones is a seasoned volunteer with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACSCAN). In the former capacity she has spoken both locally and nationally, delivering the message of early detection, prevention, treatment and hope to thousands of women, men and young girls. As the former DC State Lead Ambassador for ACSCAN, Jones has lobbied both national and local public officials for funding of tobacco control and cancer research. In April 2010, she established the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund Support Group, the signature program of the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund in Southwest DC. Focusing primarily on the historically less served communities, the support group has contributed significantly to providing a safe and secure place for emotional support for breast cancer survivors and caretakers to discuss and share their journeys, hear a range of highly skilled speakers, acquire information and resources, and give voices to those who are struggling in silence with their diagnosis. Prior to becoming a cancer advocate, Jones retired from the World Bank Group after more than 33 years. As one of the principal founders of the World Bank's institutional outreach program, Jones served as a community outreach coordinator, carrying out the Bank's global poverty mission on a local level in the areas of education, volunteer management, homelessness, training and summer employment for youth, and community development. Recognized for her long-time civic activism and advocacy, Jones has been featured extensively in the media where she speaks candidly about her cancer journey and her desire to turn her challenge into an opportunity to help others. She is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including the Mayor's Award for Community Service in the Category of Lifetime Achievement and the prestigious White House Champion of Change Award. In June 2016, Jones was selected by ACSCAN to represent the organization at the White House's Moonshot Summit, and in September, she was recognized with the 2016 State Lead Ambassador of the Year Award by ACSCAN. Jones holds an AAS Degree from Durham College, Durham, NC and is a graduate of Georgetown University Nonprofit Management Executive Certificate program, George Washington University DC Neighborhood College and Leadership Greater Washington 00'. She is also a graduate of the National Breast Cancer Coalition Project LEAD and Wesley Theological Seminary Heal the Sick Program. In addition, Jones is a founding member of both Black Benefactors, a giving circle, and Black Philanthropic Alliance, a membership organization. Since 1982, she has served on the board of the Southwest Neighborhood Assembly (SWNA) where she holds several leadership positions, including president, vice president, chair of the Nominating Committee (at least ten times), contributing writer for The Southwester, chair of both the Youth Activities Task Force and the History Task Force Black History Subcommittee. Grounded in her faith, Jones is a long-time member of St. Augustine's Episcopal Church on the Southwest Waterfront. She serves as a lay reader, member of the Altar Guild, and member of the executive team to organize annual events on Justice Thurgood Marshall, a former member of the church. Jones has one son, Jamal, grandson, Seneca, and Ozzie, her Shih Tzu. She enjoys reading, traveling, attending Jazz events, working with youth, and being a coordinating nexus of positive events.
Thelma D. Jones also completed an oral history interview with the DC Oral History Collaborative Buzzard Point Oral History Project.</p>

              <p>Deacon Clarence Haywood was born in 1947 in Camilla, Georgia, and he grew up with his mother, grandparents, and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister). For a time they stayed with their father in Atlanta, GA, but they soon returned to Camilla to live with his mother's parents because of issues between his parents. His grandfather, Roy Caesar, was a well-known farmer in Mitchell County, Georgia, and his grandmother was a registered nurse in Camilla. His mother worked in a factory, but she was often battling illness and worked less hours than many of her colleagues. After graduating high school in 1965, Deacon Haywood served in the US Navy for four years. Upon leaving the service, he settled in D.C. and began working at the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a hospital corpsman. He had never visited to D.C. before, and he was the first of his family to migrate north. NIH then paid for him to attend Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, and become a registered nurse. Upon graduating in 1975, he began a forty-year career in nursing. Deacon Haywood has been a deacon at New Bethel Church of God in Christ in Takoma Park, D.C., for over three decades.</p>

              <p>Thelma D. Jones' work has been fundamental to civic and youth activism and raising awareness of breast health. She is an award-winning community activist, breast cancer survivor, advocate, and founder of the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund. Diagnosed in 2007 with a rare (unknown primary) and aggressive form of breast cancer (HER2+), her treatment regimen included chemotherapy, surgery (lumpectomy) and radiation. Jones is a seasoned volunteer with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACSCAN). In the former capacity she has spoken both locally and nationally, delivering the message of early detection, prevention, treatment and hope to thousands of women, men and young girls. As the former DC State Lead Ambassador for ACSCAN, Jones has lobbied both national and local public officials for funding of tobacco control and cancer research. In April 2010, she established the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund Support Group, the signature program of the Thelma D. Jones Breast Cancer Fund in Southwest DC. Focusing primarily on the historically less served communities, the support group has contributed significantly to providing a safe and secure place for emotional support for breast cancer survivors and caretakers to discuss and share their journeys, hear a range of highly skilled speakers, acquire information and resources, and give voices to those who are struggling in silence with their diagnosis. Prior to becoming a cancer advocate, Jones retired from the World Bank Group after more than 33 years. As one of the principal founders of the World Bank's institutional outreach program, Jones served as a community outreach coordinator, carrying out the Bank's global poverty mission on a local level in the areas of education, volunteer management, homelessness, training and summer employment for youth, and community development. Recognized for her long-time civic activism and advocacy, Jones has been featured extensively in the media where she speaks candidly about her cancer journey and her desire to turn her challenge into an opportunity to help others. She is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including the Mayor's Award for Community Service in the Category of Lifetime Achievement and the prestigious White House Champion of Change Award. In June 2016, Jones was selected by ACSCAN to represent the organization at the White House's Moonshot Summit, and in September, she was recognized with the 2016 State Lead Ambassador of the Year Award by ACSCAN. Jones holds an AAS Degree from Durham College, Durham, NC and is a graduate of Georgetown University Nonprofit Management Executive Certificate program, George Washington University DC Neighborhood College and Leadership Greater Washington 00'. She is also a graduate of the National Breast Cancer Coalition Project LEAD and Wesley Theological Seminary Heal the Sick Program. In addition, Jones is a founding member of both Black Benefactors, a giving circle, and Black Philanthropic Alliance, a membership organization. Since 1982, she has served on the board of the Southwest Neighborhood Assembly (SWNA) where she holds several leadership positions, including president, vice president, chair of the Nominating Committee (at least ten times), contributing writer for The Southwester, chair of both the Youth Activities Task Force and the History Task Force Black History Subcommittee. Grounded in her faith, Jones is a long-time member of St. Augustine's Episcopal Church on the Southwest Waterfront. She serves as a lay reader, member of the Altar Guild, and member of the executive team to organize annual events on Justice Thurgood Marshall, a former member of the church. Jones has one son, Jamal, grandson, Seneca, and Ozzie, her Shih Tzu. She enjoys reading, traveling, attending Jazz events, working with youth, and being a coordinating nexus of positive events.

              <p>Claudia Lewis (née Claudia Johnson) was born September 30, 1937 in Ridge Spring, South Carolina. Ms. Lewis grew up on a farm in Ridge Spring with her parents, Charlie May Johnson and Ulysses Johnson, and six siblings. Though she was too young to do any serious farming, all of her siblings had to help operate the farm. In 1946, Ms. Lewis's father made the decision that the family would move up north to Washington, D.C. Upon arriving in D.C., the family lived on Howard Road SE, but they soon moved to Northeast Washington. Ms. Lewis attended the Birney School on Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE) for a few months upon arriving in Washington, but after moving to Northeast during her sixth-grade year, she attended Burrville Elementary and later Merritt Elementary School. She went on to attend Kelly Miller Junior High before graduating from McKinley High School in 1956. Ms. Lewis then went to New York for a time before returning to Washington to begin a job at the Department of the Navy. She married her husband Elton Lewis in December 1969. After beginning as a mail clerk with the Department of the Navy, Ms. Lewis later became a secretary and remained there for her whole career. In 1992 Ms. Lewis moved to Prince George's County Maryland. Ms. Lewis's husband passed away in 2014, and Ms. Lewis currently lives with her daughter in Maryland.</p>

              <p>Deacon Clarence Haywood was born in 1947 in Camilla, Georgia, and he grew up with his mother, grandparents, and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister). For a time they stayed with their father in Atlanta, GA, but they soon returned to Camilla to live with his mother's parents because of issues between his parents. His grandfather, Roy Caesar, was a well-known farmer in Mitchell County, Georgia, and his grandmother was a registered nurse in Camilla. His mother worked in a factory, but she was often battling illness and worked less hours than many of her colleagues. After graduating high school in 1965, Deacon Haywood served in the US Navy for four years. Upon leaving the service, he settled in D.C. and began working at the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a hospital corpsman. He had never visited to D.C. before, and he was the first of his family to migrate north. NIH then paid for him to attend Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, and become a registered nurse. Upon graduating in 1975, he began a forty-year career in nursing. Deacon Haywood has been a deacon at New Bethel Church of God in Christ in Takoma Park, D.C., for over three decades.</p>

              <p>Claudia Lewis (née Claudia Johnson) was born September 30, 1937 in Ridge Spring, South Carolina. Ms. Lewis grew up on a farm in Ridge Spring with her parents, Charlie May Johnson and Ulysses Johnson, and six siblings. Though she was too young to do any serious farming, all of her siblings had to help operate the farm. In 1946, Ms. Lewis's father made the decision that the family would move up north to Washington, D.C. Upon arriving in D.C., the family lived on Howard Road SE, but they soon moved to Northeast Washington. Ms. Lewis attended the Birney School on Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE) for a few months upon arriving in Washington, but after moving to Northeast during her sixth-grade year, she attended Burrville Elementary and later Merritt Elementary School. She went on to attend Kelly Miller Junior High before graduating from McKinley High School in 1956. Ms. Lewis then went to New York for a time before returning to Washington to begin a job at the Department of the Navy. She married her husband Elton Lewis in December 1969. After beginning as a mail clerk with the Department of the Navy, Ms. Lewis later became a secretary and remained there for her whole career. In 1992 Ms. Lewis moved to Prince George's County Maryland. Ms. Lewis's husband passed away in 2014, and Ms. Lewis currently lives with her daughter in Maryland.</p>

              <p>Deacon Clarence Haywood was born in 1947 in Camilla, Georgia, and he grew up with his mother, grandparents, and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister). For a time they stayed with their father in Atlanta, GA, but they soon returned to Camilla to live with his mother's parents because of issues between his parents. His grandfather, Roy Caesar, was a well-known farmer in Mitchell County, Georgia, and his grandmother was a registered nurse in Camilla. His mother worked in a factory, but she was often battling illness and worked less hours than many of her colleagues. After graduating high school in 1965, Deacon Haywood served in the US Navy for four years. Upon leaving the service, he settled in D.C. and began working at the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a hospital corpsman. He had never visited to D.C. before, and he was the first of his family to migrate north. NIH then paid for him to attend Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, and become a registered nurse. Upon graduating in 1975, he began a forty-year career in nursing. Deacon Haywood has been a deacon at New Bethel Church of God in Christ in Takoma Park, D.C., for over three decades.</p>
