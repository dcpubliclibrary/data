      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Collection consists of 260 3" x 3" Black and White photographs of the exterior of certain properties with the date and owner's name identified.  Most of the photographs are of properties in all four quadrants of the District.  There are a few photographs from the Maryland suburbs of Silver Spring, Bethesda, and Chevy Chase and Arlington, Virginia.  Most addresses consist of one photograph but many addresses have multiple images, including some interiors.  Buildings represented include both commercial and residential properties.  Of note are photographs of Peoples Drug Store locations (indicated by *).   

It is suggested that if an address is not listed, check the photograph of a nearby address to possibly see a portion of the desired address.</p>
