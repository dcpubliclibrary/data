          <p>Whitman-Walker Health, formerly Whitman-Walker Clinic, is a non-profit community health center in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment and LGBTQ healthcare. Founded as an affirming health center for the gay and lesbian community in 1978, Whitman-Walker was one of the first responders to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in DC and became a leader in HIV/AIDS education, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Whitman-Walker has expanded its services to include primary healthcare services, a stronger focus on queer women's care, and youth services.</p>
