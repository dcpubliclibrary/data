          <p>Whitman-Walker Health, formerly Whitman-Walker Clinic, is a non-profit community health center in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment and LGBTQ healthcare. Founded as an affirming health center for the gay and lesbian community in 1978, Whitman-Walker was one of the first responders to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in DC and became a leader in HIV/AIDS education, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Whitman-Walker has expanded its services to include primary healthcare services, a stronger focus on queer women's care, and youth services.</p>

          <p>Mount Pleasant is a neighborhood in Ward 1 of Washington, D.C., and is bordered by Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, and Cleveland Park. In 1991, rioting was sparked in the neighborhood by the shooting of a Salvadoran man by an African American police officer. These interviews touch on memories of the riots, community-police relations, the history of Mount Pleasant, gentrification, and how the neighborhood changed in response to the events of 1991.</p>

              <p>Linda is a native Washingtonian, growing up and spending much of her adult life in Northwest Washington, DC in/around Columbia Heights and attending McKinley Technical High School in Eckington, Northeast Washington, DC. She has lived in public housing in Southwest for 10 years, currently at Greenleaf Senior with her daughter, Chaya. Much of Linda's adult life has been defined by her role as a caretaker for Chaya and the struggles that has necessitated due to historical inadequacies in DC disability services. Linda is active in advocating for increased disability services, organizing opportunities and activities for youth through the Southwest Neighborhood Assembly, and, more recently, in organizing for increased housing rights for disadvantaged and low-income families through Empower DC.</p>

              <p>Carolyn came to DC from Detroit, MI in 2004. She works for the American Society of Landscape Architects and spent much of her time since moving to DC helping to develop community-led visions for the future of development in Southwest. Like many Southwest residents, she has become disenchanted with the process and promises of public participation programs, feeling that officials consistently ignore the plans she and other community members create, opting instead for development initiatives that hurt rather than help residents who currently live in the neighborhoods near the Buzzard Point industrial area.</p>

          <p>ARTS DC was a CETA arts program that employed over 300 theater artists, musicians, painters, dancers, poets, and other artists and arts workers in over 100 District of Columbia theaters, dance companies, galleries, music ensembles, and other arts organizations from 1977 to 1982. Artists who were employed in ARTS DC-funded jobs reflect on their ARTS DC experience, how the ARTS DC job affected their artistic careers and lives, and the impact of the program on the DC arts community. Oral history is an ideal tool to connect the stories of individual artists with the larger historical narrative of the DC arts community and of federal support of arts employment going back to the Work Projects Administration of the 1930s, and to document how the District's use of federal CETA funds for arts employment was different from that of other cities.
This project was created as part of the D.C. Oral History Collaborative, a citywide initiative to train community members in oral history skills, fund new and ongoing oral history projects, connect volunteers with oral history projects, and publicize existing oral history collections. The D.C. Oral History Collaborative is a project of D.C. Public Library, HumanitiesDC, and the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.

              <p>Rogelio Maxwell reflects on the different influences that he brings to his art, as well as his role in the development of Washington, DC's art scene in the 1970s and 80s and how he decided to turn his exhibits into multimedia art experiences. He speaks about learning the congas at a very young age and being quickly recognized for his artistic talents while growing up in Brooklyn. His life is changed when one of his professors at the School for Visual Arts in Brooklyn encourages to drop out of school and let life influence his art. He then moved to Washington DC where he would eventually open Hardart studio and became a recipient of ARTS DC: CETA funding. Rogelio Maxwell continues to make innovative mixed medium art to this day.</p>

When he turned nine his mother brought him to Brooklyn, NY, where he was raised, went to school, and eventually attended the college at the School of Visual Arts (SVA). Convinced that he needed to experience life in order to be an artist, he dropped out of art school and made his way to Washington, DC where he would eventually set up a studio. With a background in both visual arts and music, he would eventually combine the two to become a pioneer in the multimedia art that fuses different mediums.</p>

          <p>Mapping Segregation in Washington D.C.: School Integration in Ward 4 documents the transformation of Ward 4 neighborhoods and schools during the 1950s and early 1960s. Ward 4 was predominantly white in the early 1940s, but saw a shift in demographics as white families fled after the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Bolling v. Sharpe, in which public school segregation was deemed unconstitutional in the District of Columbia. This project interviews Ward 4 residents that were among the first Black and white students to attend desegregated schools.</p>

          <p>Federal City College was D.C.'s first four-year public college. Upon opening in 1968, it was flooded with eager students, including Vietnam veterans, men incarcerated at Lorton Prison, civil rights activists, and young single mothers, almost entirely working-class and African-American. As a brand-new college serving the disenfranchised people of D.C., FCC attracted faculty from all over the country. They included poet Gil Scott-Heron; C.L.R. James, perhaps the most important black Marxist of the 20th century; and civil rights activist James Garrett, who led the fight for Black Studies at San Francisco State University before helping found FCC. FCC only existed independently for eight years: in 1976, it was folded in with two other schools to create the University of the District of Columbia. But these were a fertile eight years in the city's history, encompassing the 1968 eruptions and aftermath, the civil rights organizing that led to Home Rule in 1974, and, in 1975, the launching of a city government that strove to bring progressive democracy to the place that was becoming known as Chocolate City. Students, faculty, and staff from FCC played key roles in all of this.</p>

          <p>This project documents the stories of Asian American immigrant-entrepreneurs and restaurateurs in Washington, D.C. Despite their small population size (they are four percent of the District's total population), Asian American restaurateurs have played a critical role in shaping the culinary landscape in Washington D.C. even beyond the Chinatown in Ward 2 for several decades. Many American Chinese take-out restaurants have long permeated every corner in the District. With the recent development of foodie culture, Asian American restaurateurs are introducing their heritage cuisines, diversifying Washingtonians' palates.
The cultural and commercial practices of the food industry function as a valuable lens for understanding struggles and adjustments of Asian American small business owners in D.C.</p>

              <p>Seng Luangrath was born in Vientiane, Laos where she grew up in a multi-generational home and learned to cook from her grandmother. At the age of 12, Luangrath fled Laos with her mother and brothers; her sister, who was viewed to be braver than Luangrath, stayed behind to care for her grandmother. Her family lived in refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. While living in a refugee camp in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, her mother remarried and Luangrath learned to cook various Lao regional cuisines from her stepfather. In the Philippines her family attended an English language school in preparation for moving to Berkeley, California in the United States. Luangrath attended Berkeley High School and then Laney College. In 1988 Luangrath married a man through a courtship her mother arranged, and moved with her new husband to Northern Virginia. Luangrath worked as a bank teller and accountant while her husband worked in manufacturing, food service, and flooring before the pair started a construction business for military housing. The business ultimately failed leaving the couple looking for new options. Luangrath dreamed of opening her own restaurant and the opportunity arose to take over a Thai restaurant, Bangkok Golden (now Padaek) in Falls Church, Virginia. The original menu featured Thai food but included secret Lao dishes. After a positive review from a Washington Post food critic, Luangrath began serving both Thai and Lao dishes. With encouragement from her customers and the Washington, D.C. chef community, she opened Thip Khao in Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C. with her son, Bobby Pradachith. Together Luangrath and Pradachith lead the Lao Food Movement which promotes Lao cuisine and culture and encourages ethnic minorities to be proud of their identities and cultures.</p>

              <p>Seng Luangrath was born in Vientiane, Laos where she grew up in a multi-generational home and learned to cook from her grandmother. At the age of 12, Luangrath fled Laos with her mother and brothers; her sister, who was viewed to be braver than Luangrath, stayed behind to care for her grandmother. Her family lived in refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. While living in a refugee camp in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, her mother remarried and Luangrath learned to cook various Lao regional cuisines from her stepfather. In the Philippines her family attended an English language school in preparation for moving to Berkeley, California in the United States. Luangrath attended Berkeley High School and then Laney College. In 1988 Luangrath married a man through a courtship her mother arranged, and moved with her new husband to Northern Virginia. Luangrath worked as a bank teller and accountant while her husband worked in manufacturing, food service, and flooring before the pair started a construction business for military housing. The business ultimately failed leaving the couple looking for new options. Luangrath dreamed of opening her own restaurant and the opportunity arose to take over a Thai restaurant, Bangkok Golden (now Padaek) in Falls Church, Virginia. The original menu featured Thai food but included secret Lao dishes. After a positive review from a Washington Post food critic, Luangrath began serving both Thai and Lao dishes. With encouragement from her customers and the Washington, D.C. chef community, she opened Thip Khao in Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C. with her son, Bobby Pradachith. Together Luangrath and Pradachith lead the Lao Food Movement which promotes Lao cuisine and culture and encourages ethnic minorities to be proud of their identities and cultures.</p>

              <p>Seng Luangrath was born in Vientiane, Laos where she grew up in a multi-generational home and learned to cook from her grandmother. At the age of 12, Luangrath fled Laos with her mother and brothers; her sister, who was viewed to be braver than Luangrath, stayed behind to care for her grandmother. Her family lived in refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. While living in a refugee camp in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, her mother remarried and Luangrath learned to cook various Lao regional cuisines from her stepfather. In the Philippines her family attended an English language school in preparation for moving to Berkeley, California in the United States. Luangrath attended Berkeley High School and then Laney College. In 1988 Luangrath married a man through a courtship her mother arranged, and moved with her new husband to Northern Virginia. Luangrath worked as a bank teller and accountant while her husband worked in manufacturing, food service, and flooring before the pair started a construction business for military housing. The business ultimately failed leaving the couple looking for new options. Luangrath dreamed of opening her own restaurant and the opportunity arose to take over a Thai restaurant, Bangkok Golden (now Padaek) in Falls Church, Virginia. The original menu featured Thai food but included secret Lao dishes. After a positive review from a Washington Post food critic, Luangrath began serving both Thai and Lao dishes. With encouragement from her customers and the Washington, D.C. chef community, she opened Thip Khao in Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C. with her son, Bobby Pradachith. Together Luangrath and Pradachith lead the Lao Food Movement which promotes Lao cuisine and culture and encourages ethnic minorities to be proud of their identities and cultures.</p>

              <p>In this interview, Cardell K. Richardson, Sr. discusses his focused and intentional path in search of respect and success while "putting God first".

She is known as a pioneer in the DC Public Charter School Movement having been elected the first Chairman of the DC Public Charter School Board shortly after Congress authorized it in 1996, and then having moved on to the position of Executive Director Of the organization in 2002. An exceptional educator, she is the product of parents who moved to DC from Mississippi in the Great Migration, whose own commitment to education was so strong, her mother is also a college graduate. Ms. Baker is a music lover who studied as a child at the Howard University Junior Department of Music, and eventually attended Howard University as an undergrad. However,she was so set against teaching as a career that when her mother declared she could only major in music if she chose music education, she switched to sociology and planned to be a social worker. Along the way she met her future husband , Isham Baker, at Asbury and then sang alongside him in the Howard Choir where he attended the School of Architecture, eventually becoming one of a true minority: an African American Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.</p>

She is known as a pioneer in the DC Public Charter School Movement having been elected the first Chairman of the DC Public Charter School Board shortly after Congress authorized it in 1996, and then having moved on to the position of Executive Director Of the organization in 2002. An exceptional educator, she is the product of parents who moved to DC from Mississippi in the Great Migration, whose own commitment to education was so strong, her mother is also a college graduate. Ms. Baker is a music lover who studied as a child at the Howard University Junior Department of Music, and eventually attended Howard University as an undergrad. However,she was so set against teaching as a career that when her mother declared she could only major in music if she chose music education, she switched to sociology and planned to be a social worker. Along the way she met her future husband , Isham Baker, at Asbury and then sang alongside him in the Howard Choir where he attended the School of Architecture, eventually becoming one of a true minority: an African American Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.</p>

              <p>Robert 'Bob' Northern, known professionally as Brother Ah, is an American jazz French hornist. Born in North Carolina and raised in The Bronx, Northern studied at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Vienna State Academy in the 1950s. He is perhaps best known as a session musician, working extensively in the 1950s and 1960s with musicians such as Donald Byrd, John Coltrane, Gil Evans, Sun Ra, McCoy Tyner, Roland Kirk, and the Jazz Composers Orchestra. He also worked with Don Cherry, Thelonious Monk, Freddie Hubbard, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Eric Dolphy, Charlie Haden, and John Lewis.</p>
              <p>He lived in New York City from 1963 to 1971, and after a period of increasing interest in non-Western music, visited and studied in Africa (Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania) during seven consecutive summers (1972 -1977). In the 1970s he released several albums as a bandleader; his 1974 release Sound Awareness featured Max Roach and M'Boom. These albums were reissued on CD on the Ikef Records label in the 2000s. In addition to horn playing, Northern also branched into percussion and flute performance later in his career. He taught at Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1973, Brown University from 1973 to 1982 and then at the Levine School of Music in Washington, D.C. from 1982. Northern is also the founder of the World Music Ensemble, a group which explores African, Japanese, Spanish, East Indian, Native American and American musical traditions and the founder of The Sounds of Awareness Ensemble which explores the sounds of nature and music. Northern, as Brother Ah, hosts a weekly jazz oriented radio program, The Jazz Collectors, on station WPFW in Washington.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Broth Ah speaks about his life in, and love for, Jazz music. He speaks about his family migrating north after his father had a confrontation with the Klu Klux Klan. As a young child growing up in Harlem and the Bronx in New York City, he learned the Bugle. He then enrolled in a prestigious performing arts school in New York, there he felt pressure from being one of just six black students. Military service in Korea interrupted his college education. In New York, he played in the most prestigious venues in the world, including Carnegie Hall, where he experienced racial discrimination, and legendary Jazz Clubs such as Birdland where he got to know Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He then moves to be a music professor at Dartmouth and Brown. The remainder of the oral history is dedicated to Brother Ah's time in Washington D.C. He speaks about encountering Washington, D.C. as "Chocolate City," and the thrill of playing at the Lincoln Theatre and Howard Theatre. The reader is informed that D.C. had the best ribs in America. He speaks about a lecture series on Jazz that he gave at the Smithsonian and, later, University of the District of Columbia. A wonderful story about how firefighters helped him to save his instruments. In recent years, Brother Ah has run a popular Jazz focused radio show on WPFW.</p>

              <p>Robert 'Bob' Northern, known professionally as Brother Ah, is an American jazz French hornist. Born in North Carolina and raised in The Bronx, Northern studied at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Vienna State Academy in the 1950s. He is perhaps best known as a session musician, working extensively in the 1950s and 1960s with musicians such as Donald Byrd, John Coltrane, Gil Evans, Sun Ra, McCoy Tyner, Roland Kirk, and the Jazz Composers Orchestra. He also worked with Don Cherry, Thelonious Monk, Freddie Hubbard, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Eric Dolphy, Charlie Haden, and John Lewis.</p>
              <p>He lived in New York City from 1963 to 1971, and after a period of increasing interest in non-Western music, visited and studied in Africa (Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania) during seven consecutive summers (1972 -1977). In the 1970s he released several albums as a bandleader; his 1974 release Sound Awareness featured Max Roach and M'Boom. These albums were reissued on CD on the Ikef Records label in the 2000s. In addition to horn playing, Northern also branched into percussion and flute performance later in his career. He taught at Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1973, Brown University from 1973 to 1982 and then at the Levine School of Music in Washington, D.C. from 1982.

              <p>"Melvin Deal reflects on his work performing, choreographing, managing, and promoting African dance, which he has been involved in for over half a century. He speaks about how when he started dancing it was generally understood that you had to do ballet, if you wanted to be successful. But he was drawn to African dance and decided to follow that desire. At the time, decolonization was happening in Africa. Part of his work was fighting stereotypes about Africa. He reflects that at the time they were being romantic about being Africans. His interests brought him to take his first trip to Africa in 1969.
Many of his former students were at-risk youths that credit him with having changed the direction of their lives. Through his African Heritage dancers, he won legitimacy for African culture in the community and the larger city. He speaks about educating a Washington Post writer about Africa dance and how the resulting articles led to a large uptick in attendance at African dance events. He expresses concerned about young people's sense of personhood, "I feel like I am someone now", is the feeling he wants young people to feel."</p>

              <p>"Melvin Deal reflects on his work performing, choreographing, managing, and promoting African dance, which he has been involved in for over half a century. He speaks about how when he started dancing it was generally understood that you had to do ballet, if you wanted to be successful. But he was drawn to African dance and decided to follow that desire. At the time, decolonization was happening in Africa. Part of his work was fighting stereotypes about Africa. He reflects that at the time they were being romantic about being Africans. His interests brought him to take his first trip to Africa in 1969.
Many of his former students were at-risk youths that credit him with having changed the direction of their lives. Through his African Heritage dancers, he won legitimacy for African culture in the community and the larger city. He speaks about educating a Washington Post writer about Africa dance and how the resulting articles led to a large uptick in attendance at African dance events. He expresses concerned about young people's sense of personhood, "I feel like I am someone now", is the feeling he wants young people to feel."</p>

She first performed at DanceAfrica in 1992. Her love for African dance inspires her to travel to Guinea. She speaks about how she never expected her career to take off, at first her dances focused on issues that were very personal to her. She eventually started a youth academy.

              <p>Melvin Deal has been an integral part of the Washington, D.C. African dance community for over five decades. He is a Washington, D.C. native that started dancing in 1959. He graduated from Howard University in 1965.

              <p>"Melvin Deal reflects on his work performing, choreographing, managing, and promoting African dance, which he has been involved in for over half a century. He speaks about how when he started dancing it was generally understood that you had to do ballet, if you wanted to be successful. But he was drawn to African dance and decided to follow that desire. At the time, decolonization was happening in Africa. Part of his work was fighting stereotypes about Africa. He reflects that at the time they were being romantic about being Africans. His interests brought him to take his first trip to Africa in 1969.
Many of his former students were at-risk youths that credit him with having changed the direction of their lives. Through his African Heritage dancers, he won legitimacy for African culture in the community and the larger city. He speaks about educating a Washington Post writer about Africa dance and how the resulting articles led to a large uptick in attendance at African dance events. He expresses concerned about young people's sense of personhood, "I feel like I am someone now", is the feeling he wants young people to feel."</p>

          <p>This project documents the experiences of the five final members (and one spouse) of the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC), an invitation-only poker and social club founded in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, DC, in 1942 by nine accomplished Black men — doctors, lawyers, scientists, university presidents — many with Howard University affiliations. Successive generations of BLAHC members gathered monthly for over 75 years to discuss important topics of the day (the 'literary') and to play poker (the 'hunt').</p>

              <p>Jim Butts was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1934. His parents were hard working and active in the community and church. He lived through extreme racism, segregation, and discrimination. After attending Talladega College while Bull Connor ruled Alabama, he saw no opportunities to advance as a Black man in Alabama or Kentucky, so he joined the military and was stationed in Germany for 20 months. Then he moved to D.C. to attend Howard University and earn a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. He had a long career in Federal and District government in high-level administrative positions. He has been an activist, leader, and community organizer throughout his life and worked with many civil rights organizations including Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Model Cities. He believes that youth activism and grassroots community organizing is only way to address the continuing injustices in our society and he is optimistic about current youth movements. He had a long tenure with the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC) and took over many of the duties of Chairman. BLAHC has been a very important organization for accomplished professional Black men to come together to share support, information, and resources, and, of course, to socialize, and play cards. The organization is now losing membership due to aging. Its future is uncertain.</p>

              <p>James Butts' oral history focuses on his commitment to public service. He speaks about how proud he is of working on the ground as a social worker and having been appointed by three District Mayors to run a government department. His career developed in tandem with social movements and has been motivated by a concern for justice and the lives of society's most vulnerable. He reflects on how attending university in Alabama during segregation and Bull Connor helped to inform his world view. He moved to Washington, D.C. to earn his Master of Social Work (MSW) at Howard University. After beginning a career in service, his work led him to work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Later he would play a role in founding the Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation. Butts highlights the 'literary' aspect of the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. He speaks about the ways that the club has been used as a way to discuss social and political issues. He uses Michelle Alexander's New Jim Crow, which focuses on mass incarceration, as an example of issues that they would speak about. As members aged, the club became a place for members to discuss health related issues.</p>

              <p>Wilhelmina Banks was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 1928. She recalls growing up in a loving home with close relationships with her parents and aunt. She recalled no personal negative consequences of segregated life. Her parents protected her from strife and conflict, and she had a consistent group of friends around her. She went on to college at Howard University, where she met her future husband, Quentin Banks (now deceased, former member of BLAHC). They had 4 children including Jock Banks (current member of BLAHC). She pursued graduate education in speech and language pathology and was sent to Columbia University because there were no segregated colleges in the south for her to do so. She had a long career for Prince George's County School System as a Speech Language Pathologist. She recalled her experiences playing poker with her husband and other couples and spoke about his love for BLAHC. He loved the poker, but mostly loved the conversations about current events.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Wilhelmina Banks reflects on raising her family and her work as a speech therapist in the Prince George's County, Maryland schools, where she worked for 52 years. She sees the literary and hunting club as being important as a place for the men to engage in intellectual exchanges just as much it is a place for them to play poker. A poker player herself, Wilhelmina sees the game as valuable for its social aspects. She speaks about her decision to go to Howard University, where dorm life is a key place for her to make friends. She then talks getting married a year after meeting her husband then spending the rest of her life with him. The oral history also contains her reflections on the benefits of speech therapy and laments budget cuts that have resulted in schools replacing human speech therapists with computers. She spoke about her family's beach house at Highland Beach, a historically Black beach town near Annapolis, MD which was frequented by Frederick Douglass.</p>

              <p>In the interview Frank Sanders talks about his love for poker and how sometimes he can play for 15 hours in one day. This, and his commitment to understanding the history of the African American community in Washington D.C., lead him to join the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. Sanders reflects on growing up in Chicago, Illinois, a city he found to be segregated in a manner so harsh that it was impossible to enter certain neighborhoods, and how he found Washington, D.C. to be a more cosmopolitan place to live. After receiving a degree in teaching, he spent a few years teaching third grade before going back to school to learn finance and business. He began a career in real estate, where he remained until business began to dry-up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis at which point he joined the D.C. Real Property Tax Appeals Commission. Poker, and the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club, continue to be a source of relaxation and community for him.</p>

              <p>Jim Butts was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1934. His parents were hard working and active in the community and church. He lived through extreme racism, segregation, and discrimination. After attending Talladega College while Bull Connor ruled Alabama, he saw no opportunities to advance as a Black man in Alabama or Kentucky, so he joined the military and was stationed in Germany for 20 months. Then he moved to D.C. to attend Howard University and earn a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. He had a long career in Federal and District government in high-level administrative positions. He has been an activist, leader, and community organizer throughout his life and worked with many civil rights organizations including Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Model Cities. He believes that youth activism and grassroots community organizing is only way to address the continuing injustices in our society and he is optimistic about current youth movements. He had a long tenure with the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC) and took over many of the duties of Chairman. BLAHC has been a very important organization for accomplished professional Black men to come together to share support, information, and resources, and, of course, to socialize, and play cards. The organization is now losing membership due to aging. Its future is uncertain.</p>

              <p>James Butts' oral history focuses on his commitment to public service. He speaks about how proud he is of working on the ground as a social worker and having been appointed by three District Mayors to run a government department. His career developed in tandem with social movements and has been motivated by a concern for justice and the lives of society's most vulnerable. He reflects on how attending university in Alabama during segregation and Bull Connor helped to inform his world view. He moved to Washington, D.C. to earn his Master of Social Work (MSW) at Howard University. After beginning a career in service, his work led him to work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Later he would play a role in founding the Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation. Butts highlights the 'literary' aspect of the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. He speaks about the ways that the club has been used as a way to discuss social and political issues. He uses Michelle Alexander's New Jim Crow, which focuses on mass incarceration, as an example of issues that they would speak about. As members aged, the club became a place for members to discuss health related issues.</p>

              <p>Wilhelmina Banks was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 1928. She recalls growing up in a loving home with close relationships with her parents and aunt. She recalled no personal negative consequences of segregated life. Her parents protected her from strife and conflict, and she had a consistent group of friends around her. She went on to college at Howard University, where she met her future husband, Quentin Banks (now deceased, former member of BLAHC). They had 4 children including Jock Banks (current member of BLAHC). She pursued graduate education in speech and language pathology and was sent to Columbia University because there were no segregated colleges in the south for her to do so. She had a long career for Prince George's County School System as a Speech Language Pathologist. She recalled her experiences playing poker with her husband and other couples and spoke about his love for BLAHC. He loved the poker, but mostly loved the conversations about current events.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Wilhelmina Banks reflects on raising her family and her work as a speech therapist in the Prince George's County, Maryland schools, where she worked for 52 years. She sees the literary and hunting club as being important as a place for the men to engage in intellectual exchanges just as much it is a place for them to play poker. A poker player herself, Wilhelmina sees the game as valuable for its social aspects. She speaks about her decision to go to Howard University, where dorm life is a key place for her to make friends. She then talks getting married a year after meeting her husband then spending the rest of her life with him. The oral history also contains her reflections on the benefits of speech therapy and laments budget cuts that have resulted in schools replacing human speech therapists with computers. She spoke about her family's beach house at Highland Beach, a historically Black beach town near Annapolis, MD which was frequented by Frederick Douglass.</p>

              <p>Wilhelmina Banks was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 1928. She recalls growing up in a loving home with close relationships with her parents and aunt. She recalled no personal negative consequences of segregated life. Her parents protected her from strife and conflict, and she had a consistent group of friends around her. She went on to college at Howard University, where she met her future husband, Quentin Banks (now deceased, former member of BLAHC). They had 4 children including Jock Banks (current member of BLAHC). She pursued graduate education in speech and language pathology and was sent to Columbia University because there were no segregated colleges in the south for her to do so. She had a long career for Prince George's County School System as a Speech Language Pathologist. She recalled her experiences playing poker with her husband and other couples and spoke about his love for BLAHC. He loved the poker, but mostly loved the conversations about current events.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Wilhelmina Banks reflects on raising her family and her work as a speech therapist in the Prince George's County, Maryland schools, where she worked for 52 years. She sees the literary and hunting club as being important as a place for the men to engage in intellectual exchanges just as much it is a place for them to play poker. A poker player herself, Wilhelmina sees the game as valuable for its social aspects. She speaks about her decision to go to Howard University, where dorm life is a key place for her to make friends. She then talks getting married a year after meeting her husband then spending the rest of her life with him. The oral history also contains her reflections on the benefits of speech therapy and laments budget cuts that have resulted in schools replacing human speech therapists with computers. She spoke about her family's beach house at Highland Beach, a historically Black beach town near Annapolis, MD which was frequented by Frederick Douglass.</p>

After an injury, recuperation, and completion of training, WWII ended and his service and experiences have been well documented recently. His experiences as a Tuskegee Airman have shaped his life and he carries the work ethic and perseverance he learned there into his entire life. He married his high school sweetheart, Edmonia Bailey. In 1945 he received an honorable discharge and returned to Civilian life. He and his wife moved to D.C. in 1959. He worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 35 years.

              <p>Frank Sander is a commissioner for the D.C. Real Property Tax Appeals Commission. A long-time resident of Washington, D.C., Sanders was born and raised in Chicago.

              <p>In the interview Frank Sanders talks about his love for poker and how sometimes he can play for 15 hours in one day. This, and his commitment to understanding the history of the African American community in Washington D.C., lead him to join the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. Sanders reflects on growing up in Chicago, Illinois, a city he found to be segregated in a manner so harsh that it was impossible to enter certain neighborhoods, and how he found Washington, D.C. to be a more cosmopolitan place to live. After receiving a degree in teaching, he spent a few years teaching third grade before going back to school to learn finance and business. He began a career in real estate, where he remained until business began to dry-up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis at which point he joined the D.C. Real Property Tax Appeals Commission. Poker, and the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club, continue to be a source of relaxation and community for him.</p>

          <p>The Women of the WIRE oral history project contain five video interviews conducted by Kristin Adain in 2018. Transcripts are included for all interviews.</p>
          <p>In Washington, D.C., only about five percent of those behind bars are women. But a substantial majority of these women are mothers, and many leave small children behind when they are sentenced to years or decades of incarceration. Women's experiences of incarceration are dramatically different than those of men. Moreover, their reentry process when they are released is driven by different needs and challenges many women face as a result of their roles in families and communities. Returning women often struggle with a range of social and emotional needs, including family reunification, addiction, mental health, and trauma recovery. Women in reentry must confront these social and emotional issues while facing daunting challenges in obtaining housing, employment, and other essential services.</p>
          <p>The Women of the WIRE oral history project documents and explores the unique challenges that women from D.C. face while incarcerated and after they return home, as well as the long-term impact of their incarceration on them, their families and communities. In gathering these stories, the project sought to amplify the voices of women from D.C. in conversations and policymaking about mass incarceration and criminal justice reforms in our city.</p>

          <p>Anthology of Booty documents the dynamic shifts in D.C. social spaces from the mid-2000s to the present, focusing on nightclubs, bars, dancehalls, and house parties, by gathering first-person oral histories of Anthology of Booty, an all-women DJ collective, and the communities they serve. They illuminate the collective's strategies for creating unique and welcoming social spaces against the backdrop of changes in the city. It also explores how historical patterns of segregation played out in nightlife spaces based on race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity. In turn they ask how spaces were considered "safe" or not, and how this has shifted as D.C. has changed.</p>

Lee recalls pursuing a job with the government, getting married to his wife Penny, learning the history of his parents, and the decline of Chinatown--starting with the construction of the convention center and sporting arena. Lee concludes by talking about learning more of the Chinese language, family traditions, and culture.</p>

          <p>This project interviewed current and former residents to record details about their lives and viewpoints living in a place that, although highly stigmatized and marginalized, has been their home and that of their kin and other members of vital social networks for decades. In documenting the added tension of a community undergoing the dramatic and inexorable shifts of urban redevelopment, changes the community did not request or desire, this project endeavors to capture a disappearing way of life as well as the contours of resistance to displacement.</p>

          <p>This project tells the story of life in Marshall Heights by interviewing member of the neighborhood who shaped the community, as well as reflecting on other neighbors that were active in the development of the neighborhood. The Marshall Heights neighborhood became home to many heroic Black veterans returning from World War II, as well as Black masons and carpenters, who, through their hard work and ingenuity, carved out new paths for economic development for its residents. The Marshall Heights neighborhood has an extensive history full of prideful civic accomplishments as well as its fair share of heartbreaks and missed opportunities. The community knows those notable stories of its organized efforts that led to the federal funding of a neighborhood library, and the creation of the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization that provided homeownership opportunities to many neighbors.</p>

          <p>Friends of Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens initiated this oral history project to share the park's history and its modern story. The project attempted to answer questions such as: What does the park mean to Ward 7 residents? What memories do Ward 7 residents have of it? How has it changed in the last few decades? How does it relate to a larger discussion of the significance of green spaces? The answers to these questions were meant to add to the established narrative of the park's creation to produce a more complete history.</p>

          <p>Narrators for this project developed by the Heurich House Foundation have first- or second-hand knowledge of what it was like to work at the Chr. Heurich Brewing Co. (1873-1956). The project was created, in part, to contribute to the museum's mission to expand the stories we tell so we can examine the true meaning of the 'American Dream.' Heurich's life story embodied the supposed "American Dream" yet mostly leaves out the people whose hard work made his success possible. This project sought to memorialize recollections from a group of Washingtonians whose voices have never been heard but who played a central role in turn-of-the-century DC culture, economy, and society, and help connect local DC history to issues of national importance - immigration, the racial wealth gap, and workers' rights - by elevating intimate accounts of previously unrecognized people.</p>

              <p>William "Bill" Jones was born in 1960 and grew up in District Heights, Maryland, where he lives now. He served in the U.S. Air Force and remained in the reserves when he ended his active duty career. He attended Washington College where he studied history and political science, and eventually went to law school and later earned a master's in history at the University of New Hampshire. He returned to Maryland when his parents began to age and worked in the intelligence community as a lawyer. Bill's father Parker was born in 1914 and grew up on a farm in Centennial, West Virginia, on the border of Virginia. He came to Washington during the Great Depression to earn a living and make something of himself off the farm. Parker worked his way up in the brewery, working in the ice plant while he went to school, and eventually becoming the brewery's comptroller and closing out the account books and finances of the brewery when it closed. He soon found work at the Mechanics' Union where he was their chief accountant.</p>

              <p>Christian (Chris) Squier was born in 1965 to Donald Squier and Karla Jacobsen Squier. On his mother Karla's side, he is descended from Elizabeth Heurich Jacobsen, Christian Heurich's sister. He grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey and visited his extended family in Washington, D.C. often for holidays. He attended Pfeiffer College in North Carolina, where he played lacrosse. He eventually settled in the Charlotte area where he raised two daughters and built a career as a beer marketer and salesperson at Anheuser-Busch before working as a regional sales manager at Craft Brew Alliance, where he was employed at the time of the oral history interview. Chris is interested in learning more about his family history on the Jacobsen-Heurich side and collects bottles, labels, and other items from the Christian Heurich Brewing Company and the Arlington Bottling Company. During the early – mid twentieth century, the Jacobsen family were important entrepreneurs, bankers, and members of Washington society. At the turn of the twentieth century, they owned the Arlington Bottling Company, which bottled the beer that the Christian Heurich Brewing Company produced. Other Jacobsen family businesses included a laundry business, Ford dealership, hotel, and florist shop in the Willard Hotel.</p>

              <p>Karla Jacobsen Squier was born in Washington, D.C. in 1931 to Charles J. Jacobsen and Norvelle H. Newton. Her parents divorced when she was a child and her father served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and was frequently stationed out of the city. Her grandfather on her father's side, Christian F. Jacobsen, was the president of the Metropolitan National Bank in Dupont Circle, and she remembered visiting him there as a child. Her great, great grandmother was Elizabeth Heurich Jacobsen, Christian Heurich's sister who immigrated to Baltimore and encouraged Christian to join her there. Karla grew up in the Petworth neighborhood during the Depression and World War II, but left the city in 1945 with her mother to move to San Francisco, then back to the Washington area, and finally to New Jersey to finish high school. Karla then attended college and worked in New York City in the fashion industry for a few years before moving back to New Jersey. She married Donald O. Squier and the two had two children, Christian and Dawn, but they divorced and Karla became a single mother. She took her children back to see family in Washington, D.C., often and eventually became involved in New Jersey State politics for the Republican Party – working on campaigns for Governor Thomas Kean, Sr., and eventually leading the New Jersey State Board of Elections. Karla retired from politics in 2002 and moved to North Carolina, where she remains active in local politics and serves the community by working at a foodbank.</p>

              <p>Mark Keyser was born in 1950 in Northampton, Massachusetts to Karl Anton Keyser (1918-1995) and Dorothy M. Borger (1923-2003). He grew up near Amherst in a veterans' housing project and visited his extended family in Washington, D.C. as a boy. Today Mark lives in Seabrook, New Hampshire, where he was enjoying a career as a substitute teacher until the COVID-19 pandemic hit in February/March 2020. His father Karl was Amelia Louisa Keyser Heurich's nephew and grew up in Washington, D.C., at 1777 Lanier Place, NW. Karl served as Executive Officer (second in command) in the U.S. Navy in World War II on the U.S.S. Eberle in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres of combat. He stayed in the U.S. Navy Reserve until about 1973. He earned several graduate degrees from Carnegie Mellon University (then the Carnegie Institute of Technology) in Pittsburg and had a long career as a professor of mechanical engineering and material sciences at the University of Massachusetts (Amherst?). Mark's mother Dorothy had a career as a model in New York City where she crossed paths with actress Tippi Hedren before the war. During the war she worked at Sperry on Long Island as part of the war effort. After she married and the war ended, she concentrated on raising her three children. This interview also includes material about Mark's grandfather, Adolph G. ("Dolph") Keyser Sr. (1874-1955). Dolph was an attorney in Washington who Mark remembers had an office on K Street, NW, and who he believes worked for Christian Heurich, primarily handling Heurich's real estate holdings. Dolph attended law school at Georgetown. Amelia Heurich's diary records a moment in 1914 when her brother was not promoted to a secretarial/bookkeeping position at the brewery.</p>

Parker worked his way up in the brewery, working in the ice plant while he went to school, and eventually becoming the brewery's comptroller and closing out the account books and finances of the brewery when it closed. He soon found work at the Mechanics' Union where he was their chief accountant.</p>

              <p>Karla Jacobsen Squier was born in Washington, D.C. in 1931 to Charles J. Jacobsen and Norvelle H. Newton. Her parents divorced when she was a child and her father served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and was frequently stationed out of the city.

Karla grew up in the Petworth neighborhood during the Depression and World War II, but left the city in 1945 with her mother to move to San Francisco, then back to the Washington area, and finally to New Jersey to finish high school. Karla then attended college and worked in New York City in the fashion industry for a few years before moving back to New Jersey. She married Donald O. Squier and the two had two children, Christian and Dawn, but they divorced and Karla became a single mother.

              <p>Karla Jacobsen Squier was born in Washington, D.C. in 1931 to Charles J. Jacobsen and Norvelle H. Newton. Her parents divorced when she was a child and her father served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and was frequently stationed out of the city. Her grandfather on her father's side, Christian F. Jacobsen, was the president of the Metropolitan National Bank in Dupont Circle, and she remembered visiting him there as a child. Her great, great grandmother was Elizabeth Heurich Jacobsen, Christian Heurich's sister who immigrated to Baltimore and encouraged Christian to join her there. Karla grew up in the Petworth neighborhood during the Depression and World War II, but left the city in 1945 with her mother to move to San Francisco, then back to the Washington area, and finally to New Jersey to finish high school. Karla then attended college and worked in New York City in the fashion industry for a few years before moving back to New Jersey. She married Donald O. Squier and the two had two children, Christian and Dawn, but they divorced and Karla became a single mother. She took her children back to see family in Washington, D.C., often and eventually became involved in New Jersey State politics for the Republican Party – working on campaigns for Governor Thomas Kean, Sr., and eventually leading the New Jersey State Board of Elections. Karla retired from politics in 2002 and moved to North Carolina, where she remains active in local politics and serves the community by working at a foodbank.</p>

              <p>Mark Keyser was born in 1950 in Northampton, Massachusetts to Karl Anton Keyser (1918-1995) and Dorothy M. Borger (1923-2003). He grew up near Amherst in a veterans' housing project and visited his extended family in Washington, D.C. as a boy. Today Mark lives in Seabrook, New Hampshire, where he was enjoying a career as a substitute teacher until the COVID-19 pandemic hit in February/March 2020. His father Karl was Amelia Louisa Keyser Heurich's nephew and grew up in Washington, D.C., at 1777 Lanier Place, NW. Karl served as Executive Officer (second in command) in the U.S. Navy in World War II on the U.S.S. Eberle in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres of combat. He stayed in the U.S. Navy Reserve until about 1973. He earned several graduate degrees from Carnegie Mellon University (then the Carnegie Institute of Technology) in Pittsburg and had a long career as a professor of mechanical engineering and material sciences at the University of Massachusetts (Amherst?). Mark's mother Dorothy had a career as a model in New York City where she crossed paths with actress Tippi Hedren before the war. During the war she worked at Sperry on Long Island as part of the war effort. After she married and the war ended, she concentrated on raising her three children. This interview also includes material about Mark's grandfather, Adolph G. ("Dolph") Keyser Sr. (1874-1955). Dolph was an attorney in Washington who Mark remembers had an office on K Street, NW, and who he believes worked for Christian Heurich, primarily handling Heurich's real estate holdings. Dolph attended law school at Georgetown. Amelia Heurich's diary records a moment in 1914 when her brother was not promoted to a secretarial/bookkeeping position at the brewery.</p>

              <p>Mark Keyser discusses his childhood visits to Washington, D.C. and his recollections of his grandfather, Adolph Kaiser, his Aunt Amelia Heurich and visiting her at the Heurich House, and her sisters. He discusses his father Karl Anton Keyser's U.S. Navy service during World War II, along with ancestors on the Dilger side of his family and their service in the Civil War. One Dilger relative was a German operative working in D.C. during World War I. Although Mark does not have strong memories of the brewery itself, he does recall that the brewery's stables that later became a wax museum. Mark also reflects on stories he had heard about Christian Heurich, his generosity, and on his legacy in the family, recognizing that Christian likely provided financial assistance to the Keysers at times.</p>
