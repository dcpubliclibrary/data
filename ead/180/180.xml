          <p>Whitman-Walker Health, formerly Whitman-Walker Clinic, is a non-profit community health center in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment and LGBTQ healthcare. Founded as an affirming health center for the gay and lesbian community in 1978, Whitman-Walker was one of the first responders to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in DC and became a leader in HIV/AIDS education, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Whitman-Walker has expanded its services to include primary healthcare services, a stronger focus on queer women's care, and youth services.</p>

              <p>Carolyn came to DC from Detroit, MI in 2004. She works for the American Society of Landscape Architects and spent much of her time since moving to DC helping to develop community-led visions for the future of development in Southwest. Like many Southwest residents, she has become disenchanted with the process and promises of public participation programs, feeling that officials consistently ignore the plans she and other community members create, opting instead for development initiatives that hurt rather than help residents who currently live in the neighborhoods near the Buzzard Point industrial area.</p>

          <p>ARTS DC was a CETA arts program that employed over 300 theater artists, musicians, painters, dancers, poets, and other artists and arts workers in over 100 District of Columbia theaters, dance companies, galleries, music ensembles, and other arts organizations from 1977 to 1982. Artists who were employed in ARTS DC-funded jobs reflect on their ARTS DC experience, how the ARTS DC job affected their artistic careers and lives, and the impact of the program on the DC arts community. Oral history is an ideal tool to connect the stories of individual artists with the larger historical narrative of the DC arts community and of federal support of arts employment going back to the Work Projects Administration of the 1930s, and to document how the District's use of federal CETA funds for arts employment was different from that of other cities.
This project was created as part of the D.C. Oral History Collaborative, a citywide initiative to train community members in oral history skills, fund new and ongoing oral history projects, connect volunteers with oral history projects, and publicize existing oral history collections. The D.C. Oral History Collaborative is a project of D.C. Public Library, HumanitiesDC, and the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.

              <p>Rogelio Maxwell was born in Panama City, Panama. When he turned nine his mother brought him to Brooklyn, NY, where he was raised, went to school, and eventually attended the college at the School of Visual Arts (SVA). Convinced that he needed to experience life in order to be an artist, he dropped out of art school and made his way to Washington, DC where he would eventually set up a studio. With a background in both visual arts and music, he would eventually combine the two to become a pioneer in the multimedia art that fuses different mediums.</p>

              <p>Robert 'Bob' Northern, known professionally as Brother Ah, is an American jazz French hornist. Born in North Carolina and raised in The Bronx, Northern studied at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Vienna State Academy in the 1950s. He is perhaps best known as a session musician, working extensively in the 1950s and 1960s with musicians such as Donald Byrd, John Coltrane, Gil Evans, Sun Ra, McCoy Tyner, Roland Kirk, and the Jazz Composers Orchestra. He also worked with Don Cherry, Thelonious Monk, Freddie Hubbard, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Eric Dolphy, Charlie Haden, and John Lewis.</p>
              <p>He lived in New York City from 1963 to 1971, and after a period of increasing interest in non-Western music, visited and studied in Africa (Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania) during seven consecutive summers (1972 -1977). In the 1970s he released several albums as a bandleader; his 1974 release Sound Awareness featured Max Roach and M'Boom. These albums were reissued on CD on the Ikef Records label in the 2000s. In addition to horn playing, Northern also branched into percussion and flute performance later in his career. He taught at Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1973, Brown University from 1973 to 1982 and then at the Levine School of Music in Washington, D.C. from 1982. Northern is also the founder of the World Music Ensemble, a group which explores African, Japanese, Spanish, East Indian, Native American and American musical traditions and the founder of The Sounds of Awareness Ensemble which explores the sounds of nature and music. Northern, as Brother Ah, hosts a weekly jazz oriented radio program, The Jazz Collectors, on station WPFW in Washington.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Broth Ah speaks about his life in, and love for, Jazz music. He speaks about his family migrating north after his father had a confrontation with the Klu Klux Klan. As a young child growing up in Harlem and the Bronx in New York City, he learned the Bugle. He then enrolled in a prestigious performing arts school in New York, there he felt pressure from being one of just six black students. Military service in Korea interrupted his college education. In New York, he played in the most prestigious venues in the world, including Carnegie Hall, where he experienced racial discrimination, and legendary Jazz Clubs such as Birdland where he got to know Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He then moves to be a music professor at Dartmouth and Brown. The remainder of the oral history is dedicated to Brother Ah's time in Washington D.C. He speaks about encountering Washington, D.C. as "Chocolate City," and the thrill of playing at the Lincoln Theatre and Howard Theatre. The reader is informed that D.C. had the best ribs in America. He speaks about a lecture series on Jazz that he gave at the Smithsonian and, later, University of the District of Columbia. A wonderful story about how firefighters helped him to save his instruments. In recent years, Brother Ah has run a popular Jazz focused radio show on WPFW.</p>

He speaks about how when he started dancing it was generally understood that you had to do ballet, if you wanted to be successful. But he was drawn to African dance and decided to follow that desire. At the time, decolonization was happening in Africa. Part of his work was fighting stereotypes about Africa. He reflects that at the time they were being romantic about being Africans. His interests brought him to take his first trip to Africa in 1969.
Many of his former students were at-risk youths that credit him with having changed the direction of their lives. Through his African Heritage dancers, he won legitimacy for African culture in the community and the larger city. He speaks about educating a Washington Post writer about Africa dance and how the resulting articles led to a large uptick in attendance at African dance events. He expresses concerned about young people's sense of personhood, "I feel like I am someone now", is the feeling he wants young people to feel."</p>

          <p>This project documents the experiences of the five final members (and one spouse) of the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC), an invitation-only poker and social club founded in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, DC, in 1942 by nine accomplished Black men — doctors, lawyers, scientists, university presidents — many with Howard University affiliations. Successive generations of BLAHC members gathered monthly for over 75 years to discuss important topics of the day (the 'literary') and to play poker (the 'hunt').</p>

              <p>Jim Butts was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1934. His parents were hard working and active in the community and church. He lived through extreme racism, segregation, and discrimination. After attending Talladega College while Bull Connor ruled Alabama, he saw no opportunities to advance as a Black man in Alabama or Kentucky, so he joined the military and was stationed in Germany for 20 months. Then he moved to D.C. to attend Howard University and earn a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. He had a long career in Federal and District government in high-level administrative positions. He has been an activist, leader, and community organizer throughout his life and worked with many civil rights organizations including Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Model Cities. He believes that youth activism and grassroots community organizing is only way to address the continuing injustices in our society and he is optimistic about current youth movements. He had a long tenure with the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC) and took over many of the duties of Chairman. BLAHC has been a very important organization for accomplished professional Black men to come together to share support, information, and resources, and, of course, to socialize, and play cards. The organization is now losing membership due to aging. Its future is uncertain.</p>

              <p>Wilhelmina Banks was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 1928. She recalls growing up in a loving home with close relationships with her parents and aunt. She recalled no personal negative consequences of segregated life. Her parents protected her from strife and conflict, and she had a consistent group of friends around her. She went on to college at Howard University, where she met her future husband, Quentin Banks (now deceased, former member of BLAHC). They had 4 children including Jock Banks (current member of BLAHC). She pursued graduate education in speech and language pathology and was sent to Columbia University because there were no segregated colleges in the south for her to do so. She had a long career for Prince George's County School System as a Speech Language Pathologist. She recalled her experiences playing poker with her husband and other couples and spoke about his love for BLAHC. He loved the poker, but mostly loved the conversations about current events.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Wilhelmina Banks reflects on raising her family and her work as a speech therapist in the Prince George's County, Maryland schools, where she worked for 52 years. She sees the literary and hunting club as being important as a place for the men to engage in intellectual exchanges just as much it is a place for them to play poker. A poker player herself, Wilhelmina sees the game as valuable for its social aspects. She speaks about her decision to go to Howard University, where dorm life is a key place for her to make friends. She then talks getting married a year after meeting her husband then spending the rest of her life with him. The oral history also contains her reflections on the benefits of speech therapy and laments budget cuts that have resulted in schools replacing human speech therapists with computers. She spoke about her family's beach house at Highland Beach, a historically Black beach town near Annapolis, MD which was frequented by Frederick Douglass.</p>

              <p>In the interview Frank Sanders talks about his love for poker and how sometimes he can play for 15 hours in one day. This, and his commitment to understanding the history of the African American community in Washington D.C., lead him to join the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. Sanders reflects on growing up in Chicago, Illinois, a city he found to be segregated in a manner so harsh that it was impossible to enter certain neighborhoods, and how he found Washington, D.C. to be a more cosmopolitan place to live. After receiving a degree in teaching, he spent a few years teaching third grade before going back to school to learn finance and business. He began a career in real estate, where he remained until business began to dry-up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis at which point he joined the D.C. Real Property Tax Appeals Commission. Poker, and the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club, continue to be a source of relaxation and community for him.</p>

              <p>Wilhelmina Banks was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 9, 1928. She recalls growing up in a loving home with close relationships with her parents and aunt. She recalled no personal negative consequences of segregated life. Her parents protected her from strife and conflict, and she had a consistent group of friends around her. She went on to college at Howard University, where she met her future husband, Quentin Banks (now deceased, former member of BLAHC). They had 4 children including Jock Banks (current member of BLAHC). She pursued graduate education in speech and language pathology and was sent to Columbia University because there were no segregated colleges in the south for her to do so. She had a long career for Prince George's County School System as a Speech Language Pathologist. She recalled her experiences playing poker with her husband and other couples and spoke about his love for BLAHC. He loved the poker, but mostly loved the conversations about current events.</p>

              <p>In this oral history Wilhelmina Banks reflects on raising her family and her work as a speech therapist in the Prince George's County, Maryland schools, where she worked for 52 years. She sees the literary and hunting club as being important as a place for the men to engage in intellectual exchanges just as much it is a place for them to play poker. A poker player herself, Wilhelmina sees the game as valuable for its social aspects. She speaks about her decision to go to Howard University, where dorm life is a key place for her to make friends. She then talks getting married a year after meeting her husband then spending the rest of her life with him. The oral history also contains her reflections on the benefits of speech therapy and laments budget cuts that have resulted in schools replacing human speech therapists with computers. She spoke about her family's beach house at Highland Beach, a historically Black beach town near Annapolis, MD which was frequented by Frederick Douglass.</p>

This, and his commitment to understanding the history of the African American community in Washington D.C., lead him to join the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club.

              <p>Jim Butts was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1934. His parents were hard working and active in the community and church. He lived through extreme racism, segregation, and discrimination. After attending Talladega College while Bull Connor ruled Alabama, he saw no opportunities to advance as a Black man in Alabama or Kentucky, so he joined the military and was stationed in Germany for 20 months. Then he moved to D.C. to attend Howard University and earn a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. He had a long career in Federal and District government in high-level administrative positions. He has been an activist, leader, and community organizer throughout his life and worked with many civil rights organizations including Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Model Cities. He believes that youth activism and grassroots community organizing is only way to address the continuing injustices in our society and he is optimistic about current youth movements. He had a long tenure with the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club (BLAHC) and took over many of the duties of Chairman. BLAHC has been a very important organization for accomplished professional Black men to come together to share support, information, and resources, and, of course, to socialize, and play cards. The organization is now losing membership due to aging. Its future is uncertain.</p>

              <p>James Butts' oral history focuses on his commitment to public service. He speaks about how proud he is of working on the ground as a social worker and having been appointed by three District Mayors to run a government department. His career developed in tandem with social movements and has been motivated by a concern for justice and the lives of society's most vulnerable. He reflects on how attending university in Alabama during segregation and Bull Connor helped to inform his world view. He moved to Washington, D.C. to earn his Master of Social Work (MSW) at Howard University. After beginning a career in service, his work led him to work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Later he would play a role in founding the Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) Foundation. Butts highlights the 'literary' aspect of the Brookland Literary and Hunting Club. He speaks about the ways that the club has been used as a way to discuss social and political issues. He uses Michelle Alexander's New Jim Crow, which focuses on mass incarceration, as an example of issues that they would speak about. As members aged, the club became a place for members to discuss health related issues.</p>
