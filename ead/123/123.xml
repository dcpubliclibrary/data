      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Beatrice Murphy Campbell (born June 25, 1908), also known as "Beatrice M. Murphy," was a poet, bibliographer, community volunteer, and advocate for people with disabilities. Born in Monessen, Pennsylvania, she moved to Washington, D.C. at the age of six and lived the rest of her life in the District. After graduating from Dunbar High School, Campbell worked for the Office of Price Administration and the Veterans Administration. While working for the VA, she was suspended on national security grounds; however, after four months, she was able to disprove the allegations against her and was reinstated in her position. In total, she spent 18 years with the Veterans Administration, retiring in 1959 for health-related reasons. Additionally, Campbell published seven poetry books (three with her own poetry and four featuring poetry by African American poets). She also helped establish the Negro Bibliographic and Research Center (later renamed the Minority Research Center), serving as Director and the Managing Editor for its publication, Bibliographic Survey: The Negro in Print. Campbell's friends established the Beatrice M. Murphy Foundation in her honor, with the aim to encourage the collection and dissemination of books by and about African Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Campbell spent much of her retirement as a community volunteer and was formally recognized for her service with a number of nominations and awards. She served on the Mayor's Committee on Persons with Disabilities, as well as the advisory committees of the American Foundation for the Blind, the Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind, the D.C. Commission on Aging, and Iona House. Campbell also organized a volunteer counseling service for the blind.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout her life, Campbell coped with numerous health issues, underwent extensive medical treatments, and had repeated hospitalizations. In her 30s, she was diagnosed with an arthritic and inoperable curvature of the spine. In the late 1960s, Campbell became legally blind. She died on May 12, 1993 due to heart ailments.</p>

          <p>This series consists of clippings, most of which are photocopies. The photocopies include a Washington Post article and chapter of a book, both written by Beatrice Murphy Campbell, in which she described her efforts to clear her name and reputation following her suspension from the Veterans Administration. Other notable clippings include an obituary for her son, Alvin Murphy; an article about the District of Columbia's Women's Hall of Fame call for nominees; and a piece about the DC Public Library bookmobile that mentions Campbell. A Catholic Church Parish newsletter naming Campbell as Handicapped Person of the Year is also included.</p>
