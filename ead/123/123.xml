      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Beatrice Murphy Campbell was born on June 25, 1908 in Monessen, PA.  When she was only two years old, her mother died.  In 1914 she was brought to Washington, DC where she graduated from Dunbar High School and lived there until her death in 1992.<br/>
<br/>
In order to support herself and her son, she worked in various jobs, and other positions.   Yet, she managed to achieve an impressive literary career as a poet, editor, columnist, book reviewer and bibliographer. Her literary work was all done under the name Beatrice M. Murphy. She was a dedicated advocate and promoter of African American writers.<br/>  
<br/>
In 1941 Campbell was diagnosed with an arthritic and inoperable curvature of the spine.  Against doctors' orders, despite this condition that required her to wear a body cast and braces, she worked for the Veterans Administration for some eighteen years.   In 1954, as a result of anti-communist hysteria, she was accused of subversive activity and was suspended without pay from her position as a clerk with the VA. After a four-month ordeal to clear her name, she was reinstated to her position. In 1959 she retired from that agency on disability.  In the late 1960's she became legally blind and soon began to work with her ophthalmologist as a peer councilor to help others to cope with blindness or the threat of a loss of vision.<br/>
<br/>
In 1965 Campbell, along with others established The Negro Bibliographic and Research Center, Inc., later renamed The Minority Research Center, Inc. Despite being legally blind, she headed the Center serving as the Director.   In addition, she was the Managing Editor for, Bibliographic Survey: The Negro in Print, the Center's publication. Among subscribers to the Bibliographic Survey were Federal government departments and major universities and colleges in the U.S. and abroad.   In 1977 her friends incorporated the Beatrice M. Murphy Foundation to encourage the collection and dissemination of books by and about African Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Campbell spent much of her retirement as a community volunteer and was formally recognized for service to the community with nominations and awards. In 1983 she received a meritorious service award from Mayor Marion Barry.  These activities included testimony on the D.C. State Plan for the Aging and advocacy for improvement and other community problems and conditions that have an impact and effect on seniors, the elderly blind or the elderly physically disabled.  For her outstanding civic contributions The Community Service Award was renamed the Beatrice Murphy Campbell Community Service Award in 1992 upon the passing of Ms. Campbell, a devoted member of the Mayor's Committee on Persons with Disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout most of her life, she lived with numerous health problems, underwent extensive medical treatments and repeated hospitalizations.  On May 12, 1992, Campbell died from heart ailments.</p>
