      <p>The Max Peterson Oral History Project is a companion project to the Center for Inspired Teaching 'Real World History' Oral History Project. This project includes interviews with Cosby Hunt, a native Washingtonian and creator of the Real World History Class, and Ms. Edith Crutchfield, a long-time D.C. resident who moved to Washington from Culpeper, Virginia, in 1953. Ms. Crutchfield first became involved with Real World History when she collaborated on an oral history project with a student in the fall of 2018. Ms. Edith's interview from Real World History can be found in the Center for Inspired Teaching 'Real World History' Oral History Project. The interviews in this collection, of both Mr. Hunt and Ms. Crutchfield, take a life history approach in which the interviewees discuss some of their life experiences beginning with their early life. Over the course of several interviews, Mr. Hunt discusses his upbringing in Washington, his career as a high school history teacher, and the development of the Real World History Class; Ms. Edith discusses her upbringing in Culpeper, her move to Washington in 1953, and her life and career in the District.</p>
