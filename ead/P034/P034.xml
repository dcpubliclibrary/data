      <p>Originating at the turn of the 20th century as the Office of Public Buildings and grounds, in 1925 the name was changed to Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital ("National Capital Parks" for short as the majority of images are stamped).  On August 10, 1933 NCP became a unit of the National Park Service.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Original series categories were maintained and where category names were unknown (due to missing file folder tabs), category names were devised.  Many images were found loose and categories for these were also devised.  Each image was placed into individual sleeves, placed in acid-free folders and transferred to archival storage boxes.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>While the collection consists of images from 1863 to 1972, the majority range from the 1930s to 1950s.  The collection is broken down into forty series categories that document places, events and people associated with the National Capital Parks, a unit of the National Park Service since 1933.</p>
