      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Iona Senior Services was founded in 1975 as Iona House to create programs to provide social services to people surrounding the Tenleytown Neighborhood. In 1982 Iona was named a lead agency with the D.C. Office of Aging, which enabled them to take their programs to other sections of the city.  St. Mary's Court is a non-profit corporation operating a residential living facility for seniors 62 years of age or older or individuals with accessibility needs. Sponsored by the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, it is financed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Persons of all racial, ethnic, social, political and religious backgrounds are welcome.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>After the initial donation to the Library, the transcripts were placed in folders and stored them in a filing cabinet with other oral histories. Tapes were a cabinet for patron access. In 2014, the tapes and transcripts were digitized and in 2017 the collection was reprocessed. Transcripts were placed into folders and boxed. Audio cassettes were organized and placed into a box for long term storage.  All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file.</p>
