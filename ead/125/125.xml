      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>John Capozzi is a Democratic politician in the District of Columbia. After graduating from Shippensburg University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Administration, he moved to Washington, D.C. to attend American University, where he earned a Masters of Public Administration. He then entered the District's political scene by working on several campaigns and serving on various committees as a representative of the District's sixth ward. Capozzi was a member of the D.C. Democratic State Committee, the D.C. Statehood Commission, and Ward 6 Democrats. He also became president of the Barney Circle Neighborhood Association in 1993. The following year, Capozzi was elected as the D.C. Shadow Representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from January 1995 to January 1997. He was the second person to serve in this office. During this time, Capozzi undertook many efforts to achieve statehood for the District, including letter writing and media campaigns, lobbying in Congress, and even attempting to bring suit against the United States Government for violation of human rights. Capozzi remains active in the D.C. political scene, continuing to raise awareness for statehood and working on political campaigns.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to his political endeavors, Capozzi owned and operated a technical recruiting firm called C Associates. As a business owner, Capozzi followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, Dominico "Louis" Capozzi, who built a successful dry cleaning and tailoring business, Belcap Co., after immigrating to the United States in 1912. Capozzi has also worked for BMRi Consulting and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer of the District of Columbia.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series includes materials that document the ongoing fight for statehood and the transformation of the District of Columbia into the state of New Columbia, especially related to the work of John Capozzi during his time as the U.S. Shadow, or Statehood, representative. Other key players in the fight for statehood include D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Reverend Jesse Jackson, and former D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly. The series contains press clippings, correspondence, financial information and meeting materials from the D.C. Statehood Commission, and media materials such as fliers and scripts for commercials. These materials cover several issues related to the fight for statehood, including information about similar struggles in Alaska and Puerto Rico, retrocession of D.C. territory to Maryland, and the various arguments for and against full rights of statehood for Washington D.C. </p>
          <p>Two important events that occurred during the fight for statehood in the 1990's were the Peanut Boycott and the attempts to argue that the U.S. government's refusal to grant statehood to the district is a violation of human rights. </p>
          <p>In the early 1990's, a dispute erupted over what some statehood activists viewed as a deliberate block of their cause by conservative Southern states. As a result, the Statehood Solidarity Committee called for a local and national boycott of peanut and pecan-related products, which are a major source of revenue for several of the states that were being perceived as the opposition. This portion of the collection includes press clippings, fliers, and reports relating to the nut boycott and the relationship between nut-producing states and the fight for statehood, including the 1992 report by Statehood Solidarity Committee founder Timothy Cooper in which Cooper calls for the ban. </p>
          <p>Advocate organizations for D.C. statehood such as the Statehood Solidarity Committee have sought to gain support for their cause through arguments that refusal of Advocate organizations for D.C. statehood such as the Statehood Solidarity Committee have sought to gain support for their cause through arguments that refusal of Congressional representation violates the basic human rights of D.C. citizens. Throughout the early 1990's and especially in 1993, activists filed complaints on these grounds with the United Nations and the Organization of American States, prompting investigations and hearings on the issue. The reports, correspondence, and press materials related to these events reflect that the majority of these petitions were dismissed or ignored due to lack of grounds for the complaints or improper procedures on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series documents the controversy and events surrounding the proposed construction of a freeway bridge across the Anacostia River to link Interstates 295 and 395. The controversial plan was originally conceived in 1983. The controversy lasted for many years and was a core issue of Capozzi's political career during the 1990's. While proponents claimed that building the connector would help to relieve heavy traffic in the streets of residential neighborhoods, opponents argued that not only would it have little effect on traffic, but that the potential for increased traffic in the Barney Circle area, as well as the use of riverside parkland for the construction of the new bridge, would in turn be detrimental to the Barney Circle community. Several other issues became connected with the controversy over the Barney Circle Freeway, including social issues relating to the racial and economic demographics of the community through which the construction was proposed, connections between the Barney Circle Freeway and the proposed construction of the new Jack Kent Cooke Football Stadium and the Children's Island theme park, funding for other transportation efforts such as the Metro system, the effects of the construction on Anacostia Park, and negative environmental impacts. The controversy affected the mayoral administrations of Marion Barry, who served from 1979-1991, Sharon Pratt Kelly, who served from 1991-1995, and Barry again after he retook office from 1995-1999. After over a decade of controversy, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton announced in 1997 that plans for the project were officially cancelled and that the nearly $200 million fund for the project would be reallocated for other transportation projects. This series includes press clippings and releases, reports, memoranda and correspondence (including citizens' letter writing campaigns addressed to both mayors), and background information related to this controversy. </p>
          <p>In 1993 a legal team led by Fern Shepard from the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) after it was discovered that the soil in the proposed construction area was contaminated with high levels of lead. The lawsuit alleged that the FHWA was violating several laws in moving forward with the project and demanded that construction be halted and a new environmental impact report be created. The series includes reports, complaint files, memoranda and correspondence, press clippings and releases, and background information related to this lawsuit. </p>
          <p>One of the strongest arguments used by opponents of the freeway was a proposal for an alternative solution designed by architect and civil engineer Joseph Passonneau (1921-2011). Passonneau, former dean of the School of Architecture at Washington University in St. Louis, was a well-known and respected architect who in the 1960's was instrumental in helping to convince Congress and St. Louis officials to build the Gateway Arch.  Passonneau's design for an alternative to the Barney Circle Freeway utilized four new ramps, rather than the proposed new four-lane bridge, to ease the traffic flow. The series includes reports, fliers, and press materials that explain and advocate for Passonneau's design.</p>
