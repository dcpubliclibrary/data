      <p>After the initial donation to the Library, the transcripts were placed in folders and stored them in a filing cabinet with other oral histories. Tapes were duplicated by the Library with use copies being placed a cabinet, while the originals were placed into off-site cold storage. In 2014, the tapes and transcripts were digitized and in 2017 the collection was reprocessed. Transcripts were placed into folders and boxed. Tapes were organized and boxed for long term storage. All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file.</p>
